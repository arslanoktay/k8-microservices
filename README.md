> Microservices-based sample platform demonstrating synchronous REST/gRPC, asynchronous event streaming with Kafka + Protobuf, centralized gateway with JWT validation, and typical cross-cutting concerns (validation, persistence, OpenAPI).

## üîç Project Overview

This project is a small-scale healthcare microservices example. It showcases common patterns used in enterprise microservice systems:

-   **Auth Service**: issues and validates JWT tokens for clients.
-   **API Gateway**: central entry point that validates JWTs and routes requests to downstream services.
-   **Patient Service**: canonical CRUD REST API for patient records (Spring Boot + JPA).
-   **Billing Service**: exposes gRPC endpoints for billing-related operations.
-   **Analytics Service**: Kafka consumer that processes domain events (serialized with Protobuf).
-   Additional services (User/Order/etc.) can be plugged in similarly.

The system demonstrates:
-   sync communication via REST and gRPC,
-   async event-driven communication via Kafka,
-   security via JWT validated at the gateway,
-   service-specific persistence (Postgres/H2/JPA),
-   OpenAPI/Swagger UI for REST endpoints,
-   containerized setup (Docker / Docker Compose) for local development.

## üß© Architecture & Communication Flow

<img width="630" height="352" alt="resim" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f4c6265-76e2-483b-9ce8-a25e65891052" />

1.  **Client ‚ûú API Gateway**  
    Clients authenticate to Auth Service (via `/login`) and receive a JWT. The client sends the JWT to the **API Gateway** on each request (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`). The Gateway validates the token and routes requests to relevant services.

2.  **Gateway ‚ûú Services (REST / gRPC)**  
    -   REST: Gateway forwards HTTP requests to services such as Patient Service.  
    -   gRPC: Services may call each other via gRPC (e.g., Billing Service exposes gRPC APIs used by other services or by internal processes).

3.  **Event Bus (Kafka + Protobuf)**  
    Domain events (e.g. patient.created / patient.updated) are published to Kafka topics. Analytics Service subscribes to those topics, deserializes Protobuf messages and processes them.

4.  **Persistence**  
    Each stateful service manages its own data (PostgreSQL or H2 for tests). Migrations can be handled with Flyway (useful to add if required).

## üß± Services & Key Tech (per service)

### API Gateway
-   **Purpose:** central entry point, JWT validation, routing, rate-limiting (optional), can host resiliency filters.
-   **Tech:** Spring Cloud Gateway (`spring-cloud-dependencies` in `dependencyManagement`), Spring Boot.
-   **Responsibility:** validate JWT with Auth Service (or introspect token), forward requests to internal services.

### Auth Service
-   **Purpose:** authenticate users, issue JWT tokens, token validation endpoint.
-   **Tech:** Spring Boot, Spring Security, JJWT (`io.jsonwebtoken`), PostgreSQL (JPA), `springdoc-openapi`.
-   **Exposed endpoints:**
    -   `POST /login` ‚Üí returns JWT on successful credentials
    -   `GET /validate` ‚Üí validates token (used by Gateway or debugging)

### Patient Service
-   **Purpose:** REST CRUD API managing patients (public/internal API via Gateway).
-   **Tech:** Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL (H2 for tests), OpenAPI (`springdoc`), gRPC stubs present (if interop needed).
-   **Endpoints (sample):**
    -   `GET /patients` ‚Üí list patients
    -   `POST /patients` ‚Üí create patient (validations using `@Validated` and groups)
    -   `PUT /patients/{id}` ‚Üí update patient
    -   `DELETE /patients/{id}` ‚Üí delete patient

### Billing Service
-   **Purpose:** billing-related operations exposed via gRPC.
-   **Tech:** gRPC (`grpc-netty-shaded`, `grpc-protobuf`, `grpc-stub`), protobuf definitions, Spring Boot gRPC starter.
-   **gRPC methods (example):**
    -   `createBillingAccount(BillingRequest) ‚Üí BillingResponse`
    -   (Implementations use `StreamObserver` as in your `BillingGrpcService`)

### Analytics Service
-   **Purpose:** consumes Kafka events (topic: `patient`) and performs analytics / logging / downstream processing.
-   **Tech:** Spring Boot, Spring Kafka, Protobuf (`protobuf-java`), `spring-kafka-test` for testing.
-   **Behavior:** `@KafkaListener(topics = "patient", groupId = "analytics-service")` deserializes Protobuf bytes into `PatientEvent` and processes.

---

## üîê Security (JWT + Gateway)
-   **Authentication flow:**
    1.  Client performs `POST /login` (Auth Service) ‚Üí receives JWT.
    2.  Client includes `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on requests to Gateway.
    3.  Gateway validates token (either by introspecting with Auth Service `/validate` or verifying signature via public key / shared secret).
    4.  If valid, Gateway forwards request to downstream service (optionally adding `X-User-Id` header).
-   **Notes:**
    -   Auth Service uses JJWT to sign tokens.
    -   Gateway performs token validation to avoid sending unauthenticated requests to internal services.
    -   Internal services can trust the Gateway and perform lightweight checks (or validate tokens themselves for defense-in-depth).
